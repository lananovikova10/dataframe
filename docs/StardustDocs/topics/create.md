There are several ways to create dataframes from the data that is already loaded into memory:
* [create columns with data](createColumn.md) and then [bundle them](createDataFrame.md) into `DataFrame`
* create and initialize `DataFrame` directly from values using `vararg` variants of the [corresponding functions](createDataFrame.md) .
* [convert Kotlin objects](createDataFrame.md#todataframe) into `DataFrame` 

To learn how to read dataframes from files and URLs go to [the next section](read.md).
